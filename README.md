A sexy pinnacle of engineering thatâ€™s nonetheless incredibly inefficient and expensive and goes out of business because it canâ€™t find enough use. It also provides some tools to deal with the browser.

## Packages

This repository contains a collection of modules used internally by WeTransfer to build our website. You can use them all together or individually, based on your needs.

| Package | Version | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| [concorde-browser](https://github.com/WeTransfer/concorde.js/tree/master/modules/browser) | [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40wetransfer%2Fconcorde-browser.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40wetransfer%2Fconcorde-browser) | Browser capabilities detection |
| [concorde-cookie](https://github.com/WeTransfer/concorde.js/tree/master/modules/cookie) | [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40wetransfer%2Fconcorde-cookie.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40wetransfer%2Fconcorde-cookie) | Read, write and clean cookies |
| [concorde-debounce](https://github.com/WeTransfer/concorde.js/tree/master/modules/debounce) | [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40wetransfer%2Fconcorde-debounce.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40wetransfer%2Fconcorde-debounce) | Debounce functions for regular and async functions |

## Usage

Please check individual packages documentation for concrete usage and installation. In a nutshell, it works like that:

With ES6 modules:
```js
// Load the full build.
import Browser from '@wetransfer/concorde-browser';

Browser.isMobile
// => true
```

In Node.js:
```js
// Load the full build.
const browser = require('@wetransfer/concorde-browser');

Browser.platform('windows');
// => false
```

## Release process

First, make sure that you have an NPM account at [https://www.npmjs.com/](https://www.npmjs.com/), and you are part of the WeTransfer developer's team. Use `npm login` to store the credentials on the client aka, your computer. Check that your authentication token for `registry.npmjs.org` is part of your `~/.npmrc` file.

We use `lerna` to manage our monorepo, and publishing new versions of our modules is also part `lerna`'s responsability. Please run `npm run semantic-release` to publish a new version(s), it should do the following:

* Checkout master, pull and rebase last changes
* Create a new branch to release from
* `lerna` will publish to NPM only the modules that changed since the last commit
* Push the changes to GitHub (changelog and new package version)

It's still your responsability as a developer to create the PR on GitHub and ask a maintainer to merge it.

### What if something goes wrong?

In the unlikely event of a broken release process or water landing, it is still possible to publish the modules manually to NPM. Please follow these steps:

* Create a new branch: `git checkout -b release`
* Change directory to the module you want to publish: `cd modules/foo`
* Bump the version of the package. You must decide if it is mayor, minor or patch.
* Update the CHANGELOG.md file.
* Commit your changes: `git add package.json CHANGELOG.md && git commit -m "chore(release): npm publish ðŸ“¦ [ci-skip]"`
* Create a new tag with the new version: `git tag -a @wetransfer/concorde-module@version -m "@wetransfer/concorde-module@version"`
* Release the module to NPM: `npm publish`
* Repeat with the rest of the modules, if any.
* Push your changes: `git push --no-verify --follow-tags --set-upstream origin feature`

## Integrations tests

We run some very basic integration tests to check if our final bundle works properly in a real browser:
- Run `npm run serve:dist` to start the node server.
- Create a folder named `__e2e__` inside the module you want to test.
- Create a file named `index.html`, which will import the final module and write some results on the page.
- Write some specs in `index.spec.js` with [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) and [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer).
- Run the tests with `npm run test:integration`
